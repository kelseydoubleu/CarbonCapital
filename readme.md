## What it does

Carbon Capital is a digital board game where four players represent different sectors—developers, policymakers, community organizers, and architects—each with competing interests and resources. Players must negotiate, trade, and compromise to achieve carbon-negative outcomes in East Harlem.

The game demonstrates that no single stakeholder can solve climate challenges alone. Win conditions require cross-sector collaboration, forcing players to experience firsthand why systemic change demands negotiation rather than top-down mandates or individual action.

## Context

Developed as part of the "Carbon Capital" thesis at Columbia GSAPP exploring systemic approaches to decarbonization. The game serves as both a research tool (testing which stakeholder configurations enable climate action) and a pedagogical device (teaching players that carbon-negative development is fundamentally a coordination problem).
